A small DHCP server in python.

Run as root "python dhcp_server.py"

Network configuration is set in "config.py", the corresponding interface has to be up and configured.

DISCLAIMER: this is not a complete implementation. In particular, this server is not RFC2131 compliant. Do not try it at home ;)
